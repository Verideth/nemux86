# Contributing Guidelines

## When to contribute?

You should contribute to the repository whenever you see something that could benefit. Whether that is a simple coding change, 
or a full blown new feature. That depends upon you.

## What are the guidelines for contributing

I have a template inside of push requests, but the basic guideline is as follows:

### Describe the bug
A clear and concise reason and description of what the bug is.

### To reproduce
A clear and concise step by step process on how to reproduce the bug.

### Expected behavior
A clear and concise description of why this happens, and what happens when it does.

### Screenshots
Post screenshots of the bug

### What is the fix? Why?
A nice description on what fixes it, and why it fixes it (your push request should have the added code as well).

### Benchmark tests
If it's a performance fix, then benchmark tests are required.
