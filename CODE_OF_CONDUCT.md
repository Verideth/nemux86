# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Community Pledge

In an effort to help stop toxicity and negativity on the internet, I have created this
to all those who wish to contribute to the open source project, that is nemux86. If posting,
you will not respond negatively, debilitatingly, or uselessly to another individual that contributes
or posts to nemux86. Or risk being barred from contributing again.

## Community Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accepting constructive criticism
* Using constructive criticism over just criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* People of all skill levels contributing
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling, clickbaiting, and or spamming:
* Being disrespectful of others ideas
* Using negative, debilitating language
* Submitting useless push requests
* Derailing a topic for no apparent reason

## Scope

This code of conduct only applies to my project. I personally want a kind,
constructive, and professional project. And to help get that want, I created
this.

## Enforcement

Any sort of abuse towards the code of conduct will carry consequences, that
consequence varies on scenario, and my personal views.
